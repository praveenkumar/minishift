[[overview]]
== Overview

This section contains solutions to common problems that you might encounter while using Minishift.

[[minshift-update-failed-due-to-permission-denied]]
== Permission denied error when updating Minishift

When updating Minishift using `minishift update`, the update process needs write permissions for the Minishift binary as well as the directory in which it is located.
Without these permisions `minishift update` will fail.
This is for example an issue when installing Minishift as root.

----
$ which minishift
/usr/bin/minishift

$ minishift update
A newer version of minishift is available.

Downloading https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases/download/v1.2.0/minishift-1.2.0-linux-amd64.tgz
 3.68 MiB / 3.68 MiB [===========================================================================================================================================] 100.00% 0s
 65 B / 65 B [===================================================================================================================================================] 100.00% 0s
Update failed: open /usr/bin/.minishift.new: permission denied
----

Workaround: When updating minishift use `sudo minishift update` (Linux/Unix).

[[special-characters-passwords]]
== Special characters cause passwords to fail

Depending on your operating system and shell environment, certain special characters can trigger variable interpolation and therefore cause passwords to fail.

Workaround: When creating and entering passwords, wrap the string with single quotes in the following format: `'<password>'`

[[minishift-delete-fails-undefine-snapshots]]
== Undefining virsh snapshots fail

If you use `virsh` on KVM/libvirt to create snapshots in your development workflow, and then use `minishift delete` to delete the snapshots along with the VM, you might encounter the following error:

----
$ minishift delete
Deleting the Minishift VM...
Error deleting the VM:  [Code-55] [Domain-10] Requested operation is not valid: cannot delete inactive domain with 4 snapshots
----

Cause: The snapshots are stored in *_~/.minishift/machines_*, but the definitions are stored in *_var/lib/libvirt/qemu/snapshot/minishift_*.

Workaround: To delete the snapshots, you need to perform the following steps.

.  Delete the definitions.
+

----
$ sudo virsh snapshot-delete --metadata minishift <snapshot-name>
----

.  Undefine the Minishift domain.
+

----
$ sudo virsh undefine minishift
----
+

You can now run `minishft delete` to delete the VM and restart Minishift.

[NOTE]
====
If these steps do not resolve the issue, you can also use the following command to delete the snapshots:

----
$ rm -rf ~/.minishift/machines
----
====

It is recommended to avoid using metadata when you create snapshots.
To ensure this, you can specify the `--no-metadata` flag.
For example:

----
$ sudo virsh snapshot-create-as --domain vm1 overlay1 --diskspec vda,file=/export/overlay1.qcow2 --disk-only --atomic --no-metadata
----

[[dial-tcp-missing-address]]
== KVM: Error creating new host: dial tcp: missing address

The problem is likely that the *libvirtd* service is not running.
You can check this with the following command:

----
$ systemctl status libvirtd
----

If *libvirtd* is not running, start it and enable it to start on boot:

----
$ systemctl start libvirtd
$ systemctl enable libvirtd
----

[[fail-connect-socket]]
== KVM: Failed to connect socket to '/var/run/libvirt/virtlogd-sock'

The problem is likely that the *virtlogd* service is not running.
You can check this with the following command:

----
$ systemctl status virtlogd
----

If *virtlogd* is not running, start it and enable it to start on boot:

----
$ systemctl start virtlogd
$ systemctl enable virtlogd
----

[[domain-minishift-already-exists]]
== KVM: Domain 'minishift' already exists...

If you try `minishift start` and the this error appears, ensure that you use `minishift delete` to delete the VMs that you created earlier.
However, if this fails and you want to completely clean up Minishift and start fresh, do the following:

. Check if any existing Minishift VM are running:
+

----
$ sudo virsh list --all
----

. If any Minishift VM is running, stop it:
+

----
$ sudo virsh destroy minishift
----

. Delete the VM:
+

----
$ sudo virsh undefine minishift
----

. Delete the *_.minishift/machines_* directory:
+

----
 $ rm -rf ~/.minishift/machines
----

In case all of this fails, you might want to xref:../getting-started/uninstalling.adoc#[uninstall Minishift] and do a fresh install of Minishift.

[[create-vmnet-interface-permission]]
== xhyve: Could not create vmnet interface

The problem is likely that the xhyve driver is not able to clean up *vmnet* when a VM is removed.
*vmnet.framework* determines the IP address based on the following files:

* *_/var/db/dhcpd_leases_*
* *_/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.vmnet.plist_*

Reset the Minishift-specific IP database, ensure that you remove the `minishift` entry section from the `dhcpd_leases` file, and reboot your system.

----
{
  ip_address=192.168.64.2
  hw_address=1,2:51:8:22:87:a6
  identifier=1,2:51:8:22:87:a6
  lease=0x585e6e70
  name=minishift
}
----

NOTE: You can completely reset the IP database by removing the files manually but this is very risky.

[[machine-doesnt-exist]]
== VirtualBox: Error machine does not exist

If you use Windows, ensure that you set the `--vm-driver virtualbox` flag in the `minishift start` command.
Alternatively, the problem might be an outdated version of VirtualBox.

To avoid this issue, it is recommended to use VirtualBox 5.1.12 or later.

[[insufficient-privileges]]
== Hyper-V: Hyper-V commands must be run as an Administrator

If you run Minishift with Hyper-V on Windows as a normal user or as a user with Administrator privileges, you might encounter the following error:

----
Error starting the VM: Error creating the VM. Error with pre-create check: "Hyper-V commands must be run as an Administrator".
----

Workaround: You can either add yourself to the Hyper-V Administrators group, which is recommended, or run the shell in an elevated mode.

If you are using PowerShell, you can add yourself to the Hyper-V Administrators group as follows:

. As an administrator, run the following command:
+
----
([adsi]”WinNT://./Hyper-V Administrators,group”).Add(“WinNT://$env:UserDomain/$env:Username,user”)
----

. Log out and log back in for the change to take effect.

You can also use the GUI to add yourself to the Hyper-V Administrators group as follows:

. Click the *Start* button and choose *Computer Management*.
. In the *Computer Management* window, select *Local Users And Groups* and then double click on *Groups*.
. Double click on the *Hyper-V Administrators* group, the *Hyper-V Administrators Properties* dialog box is displayed.
. Add your account to the Hyper-V Administrators group and log off and log in for the change to take effect.

Now you can run the Hyper-V commands as a normal user.

[[hyperv-fails-openvpn]]
== Hyper-V: Minishift running with Hyper-V fails when connected to OpenVPN

If you try to use Minishift with Hyper-V using an external virtual switch while you are connected to a VPN such as OpenVPN, Minishift might fail to provision the VM.

Cause: Hyper-V networking might not route the network traffic in both directions properly when connected to a VPN.

Workaround: Disconnect from the VPN and try again after stopping the VM from the Hyper-V manager.
